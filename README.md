This is my first attempt building a blog website.

Tech Stack I am using in this project:
1. Next JS as FullStack framework.
2. ShadCN UI as styled component library.
3. Tailwind CSS as my styling.
4. React as base component framework.
5. React Hook Form to create good accessible forms.


What I have learned and why am I going towards attempt 2?
I tried building some components in this project. I built header, hero home and email signup form. But as code is become larger and larger, I think I could do some work organizing this. And also, I think I could choose some better colour for this website. It is not looking so good. Over all, My learnings are:

1. Building UI using components.
2. Code organization is much more important than it seems.
